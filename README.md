## About the project

This page was initially developed for the web only. But realizing the potential I decided to make a mobile version. And in current times, responsiveness is something considered basic and necessary, so that's it.

The intention was to create a game that captivates the player to continue clicking on the screen. So the idea came to do this related to the Pokémon universe.
