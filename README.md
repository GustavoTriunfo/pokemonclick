## About the project

This page was initially developed for the web only. But realizing the potential I decided to make a mobile version. And in current times, responsiveness is something considered basic and necessary, so that's it.

The intention was to create a game that captivates the player to continue clicking on the screen. So the idea came to do this related to the Pokémon universe.

One of the items created for the page was a Pokédex. Its entire structure was created in a div. This study was interesting because the logic to make this work is based on understanding how a div works. It was given a size in pixels. And within its scope, images of Pokémon were added. Because these images were within the scope but occupied an area outside the div's pixel size, they were naturally invisible. So how to view it? Allowing a setting in the div that implements a scrollbar. And ready! Within this now extensible space, you can place your information without altering other items underlying the structure of this div. After that I just put the background of this div as a Pokédex image, easy. The images of Pokémons each in their respective space...
